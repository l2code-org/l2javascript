# Lessons

Read through the lessons in `src/lessons` in your chosen text editor. You can run the lessons as you go with `node`. For example, to run lesson one, you could run the following:

`node src/lessons/1-basics.js`

# Exercises

After you've finished a particular lesson, there will be an exercise to match in `src/exercises`. As you go, you can run `npm test` in your terminal, which will run a series of tests against your exercises. You'll know you've completed an exercise successfully when the tests for that exercise pass.
